# Password Strength Checker

This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to check the strength of passwords entered by the user. It evaluates the password based on various criteria and provides feedback on its strength level.

## Features

- Checks if the password contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and digits.
- Determines if the password is common by comparing it against predefined lists of common passwords.
- Rates the password on a scale of 1 to 7 based on its length and complexity.
- Provides visual feedback to the user indicating whether the password is weak, moderate, strong, or very strong.
